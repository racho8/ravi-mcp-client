# Bulk Operations Guide

This guide explains how to use bulk update and bulk delete operations in the MCP Client.

## üîÑ Bulk Update Operations

### Overview
The system can update multiple products at once by matching products based on:
- Product name patterns (e.g., "all MacBook products")
- Category filters (e.g., "all products in Electronics")
- Segment filters (e.g., "all home office products")
- Combinations of the above

### Trigger Keywords
Use these keywords to trigger bulk updates:
- `all` - Update all matching products
- `every` - Update every matching product
- `entire` - Update entire set of matching products

### Update Keywords
- `update` - Standard update command
- `change` - Alternative update phrasing
- `set` - Direct price setting
- `modify` - Formal update term

### Examples

#### Update by Name Pattern
```
Update all MacBook products to price 2800
‚Üí Finds all products containing "MacBook" and updates their prices to 2800

Change all iPhone prices to 900
‚Üí Finds all products containing "iPhone" and updates their prices to 900

Set all Laptop1 prices to 1500
‚Üí Finds all products containing "Laptop1" and updates their prices to 1500
```

#### Update by Segment
```
Update price of all home office products to 400
‚Üí Finds all products with segment="home office" or "HomeOffice"

Change every laptop price to 1200
‚Üí Finds all products with segment="Laptops"

Set all mobile product prices to 800
‚Üí Finds all products with segment="mobiles"
```

#### Update by Category
```
Update every product in Furniture category to 500
‚Üí Finds all products with category="Furniture"

Change all Electronics prices to 1000
‚Üí Finds all products with category="Electronics"
```

### How It Works
1. **LLM interprets command** ‚Üí Returns `list_products` tool call
2. **Routes handler detects update intent** ‚Üí Looks for update keywords + "all"
3. **Filters products** ‚Üí Matches by name pattern, category, or segment
4. **Resolves UUIDs** ‚Üí Gets actual product IDs from matched products
5. **Calls update_products** ‚Üí Updates all matching products in one operation
6. **Invalidates cache** ‚Üí Clears response cache to show fresh data
7. **Returns enhanced response** ‚Üí Shows which products were updated

## üóëÔ∏è Bulk Delete Operations

### Overview
The system can delete multiple products at once using similar matching logic to bulk updates.

### Trigger Keywords
Use these keywords to trigger bulk deletes:
- `all` - Delete all matching products
- `every` - Delete every matching product  
- `entire` - Delete entire set of matching products

### Delete Keywords
- `delete` - Standard delete command
- `remove` - Alternative delete phrasing
- `erase` - Formal delete term
- `cleanup` - Used for duplicate cleanup

### Examples

#### Delete by Name Pattern
```
Delete all MacBook products
‚Üí Finds all products containing "MacBook" and deletes them

Remove all iPhone models
‚Üí Finds all products containing "iPhone" and deletes them

Erase all iPad products
‚Üí Finds all products containing "iPad" and deletes them
```

#### Delete by Segment
```
Remove all laptops in Electronics category
‚Üí Finds all products with segment="Laptops" in category="Electronics"

Delete all home office products
‚Üí Finds all products with segment="home office" or "HomeOffice"

Erase all mobile devices
‚Üí Finds all products with segment="mobiles"
```

#### Delete by Category
```
Delete all products in Furniture category
‚Üí Finds all products with category="Furniture"

Remove all Electronics items
‚Üí Finds all products with category="Electronics"
```

#### Special: Duplicate Cleanup
```
Clean up duplicate products
‚Üí Identifies duplicates and deletes recommended ones

Remove duplicate products
‚Üí Same as cleanup - analyzes and removes duplicates

Delete all duplicates
‚Üí Finds and removes duplicate products
```

### How It Works
1. **LLM interprets command** ‚Üí Returns `list_products` tool call
2. **Routes handler detects delete intent** ‚Üí Looks for delete keywords + "all"
3. **Filters products** ‚Üí Matches by name pattern, category, or segment
4. **Resolves UUIDs** ‚Üí Gets actual product IDs from matched products
5. **Calls delete_products** ‚Üí Deletes all matching products in one operation
6. **Invalidates cache** ‚Üí Clears response cache to show fresh data
7. **Returns enhanced response** ‚Üí Shows which products were deleted

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Name Resolution Pattern
Both bulk update and bulk delete use the same name resolution pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Get all products from database
const allProducts = await callMCP({ tool: 'list_products' });

// 2. Filter by name pattern (case-insensitive)
const matchingProducts = allProducts.filter(p => 
  p.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
);

// 3. Optionally filter by category
if (categoryFilter) {
  matchingProducts = matchingProducts.filter(p => 
    p.category.toLowerCase() === categoryFilter.toLowerCase()
  );
}

// 4. Optionally filter by segment
if (segmentFilter) {
  matchingProducts = matchingProducts.filter(p => 
    p.segment?.toLowerCase() === segmentFilter.toLowerCase()
  );
}

// 5. Extract UUIDs
const productIds = matchingProducts.map(p => p.id);

// 6. Call bulk operation
await callMCP({ 
  tool: 'update_products' | 'delete_products',
  parameters: { product_ids: productIds, ... }
});
```

### Cache Invalidation
After any mutation operation (create, update, delete), the system invalidates:
- All cached query responses (30-second cache)
- Specific category/segment caches if applicable

This ensures subsequent queries return fresh data.

### Error Handling
- **No matches found** ‚Üí Returns error message indicating no products matched
- **Product not found** ‚Üí Tries partial name matching as fallback
- **MCP server error** ‚Üí Returns detailed error message with troubleshooting info

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Bulk Updates
1. **Be specific with patterns** - "Update all MacBook Pro 16-inch" is better than "Update all Mac"
2. **Use consistent pricing** - Bulk updates set all products to the same price
3. **Verify before updating** - Use queries to see which products will be affected
4. **Check results** - Review the response to confirm expected products were updated

### For Bulk Deletes
1. **Double-check before deleting** - Bulk deletes are permanent
2. **Start with queries** - Use "Show all X products" to see what will be deleted
3. **Use specific filters** - Combine name + category for precision
4. **Review confirmation** - Check the deleted products list in the response

### Testing Commands
Before running bulk operations, test with queries:

```bash
# Check what will be affected
Show all MacBook products
‚Üí See which products match

# Then run bulk operation
Delete all MacBook products
‚Üí Deletes the products you just saw
```

## üìù Common Patterns

### Update All Products in a Category
```
Update all products in Electronics to 500
Update every Furniture item to 300
Set all Office furniture prices to 250
```

### Update All Products with Name Pattern
```
Update all iPhone products to 899
Change every MacBook price to 2500
Set all iPad prices to 799
```

### Delete All Products in a Segment
```
Delete all home office products
Remove all laptop products
Erase all mobile devices
```

### Delete All Products with Name Pattern
```
Delete all MacBook products
Remove all iPhone models
Erase all discontinued items
```

## üöÄ Quick Reference

| Operation | Single Item | Bulk Operation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Update** | `Update iPhone 15 to 899` | `Update all iPhone products to 899` |
| **Delete** | `Delete Acer Laptop` | `Delete all Acer products` |
| **Trigger Words** | Specific product name | `all`, `every`, `entire` |
| **MCP Tool Used** | `update_product` / `delete_product` | `update_products` / `delete_products` |
| **Name Resolution** | Exact match ‚Üí Partial match | Pattern matching + filtering |

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "No products found matching pattern"
- Check product names with: `Show all products`
- Verify spelling and case sensitivity
- Try broader search terms

### "Bulk operation not yet implemented"
- Only delete_products might show this error
- Fallback to single deletes or wait for implementation

### "Could not find product"
- Product name might be misspelled
- Use `Show all products` to see exact names
- Try partial name matching

### Updates/Deletes Don't Appear
- Cache might still show old data (30 seconds)
- Refresh your query or wait a moment
- Check MCP server logs for errors
